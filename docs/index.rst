Handbook for Utility Modeling in Social Decision-Making
**********************

In this handbook, we will walk, step-by-step, through the process of computationally modeling behavior in value-based social decision-making tasks - complete with conceptual examples and four fully fledged walk-throughs that you can complete yourself. 
You can expect to learn about what utility models are, why one would use them to capture behavior in social decision-making paradigms, and how to computationally implement them. 
There is no required foreknowledge to conceptually understand the course, but a basic knowledge of statistical programming (i.e. MatLab, R, or Python) is of course required to implement this in your own research.
