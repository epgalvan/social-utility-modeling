Compare Competing Accounts of Behavior
**********

Now we're in the home stretch. 
We've gone through all of these steps to get here: the point where we can now draw conclusions about human decision-making and how it is influenced by their social preferences. 

Goals During this Stage
==========

We're going to compare models against each other now. 
While we've already determined what the best model is, we haven't yet tested the hypotheses that it embodies. 


.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Plain English

        We're going to compare MFIs for various models within subjects using uncorrected paired t-tests. 
        Remember that we have to exclude any subjects for whom the model perfectly explains behavior. 
        Also, if we hypothesized that our favored model would outperform other models, we should use directional tests.

        .. Note::

            You should never correct for multiple comparisons when testing computational models against each other. 
            Your model fits the data best: you're testing the best model, and the best model only, against all of the other models in your set. 
            One of those models in your model set will have the lowest lower boundary of their confidence interval - this is the model we want to test against (this is usually the second-best performing model but not necessarily). 
            There is no reason to compromise our power when we are making multiple comparisons only to facilitate testing your model against the best challenger.

    .. tab-item:: R

        excluded1 = which(subjectData$modelSS == 0 | altSubjectData$modelAlt1SS == 0)
        excluded2 = which(subjectData$modelSS == 0 | altSubjectData$mode2Alt1SS == 0)

        t.test(subjectData$modelAIC[-excluded1], altSubjectData$modelAlt1AIC[-excluded1], paired = T, alternative = 'less') #favored model should be less than the other model (i.e. better model fit)
        t.test(subjectData$modelAIC[-excluded2], altSubjectData$modelAlt2AIC[-excluded2], paired = T, alternative = 'less')
