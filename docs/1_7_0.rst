Goals During this Stage
================

To examine our model predictions in an efficient way and to potentially generate theoretical, sampling invariant, theoretically valid a priori groupings. 
Essentially, this a valid, unbiased way to *classify* subjects' behavior in your task without making any arbitrary assertions about who falls into which group.

.. dropdown:: Clustering Algorithms

    Clustering Algorithms are generally used to determine 1) how many groups are in a data set and 2) the group that people belong to in a data set. 
    They do this by taking one observation of multiple variables (columns) for many people (rows). 
    As an input Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), which is what we will be using, takes a distance matrix. 
    A distance matrix is a square matrix with as many rows and columns as the number of rows in our data set. 
    Every cell below the diagonal (i.e. the second-last row of the first column, the third-last row of the second column, etc.) represents a distance. 
    Here, distance is often *Euclidean* meaning it is just an extension of Pythagorean Theorem - it equals the sum of all squared differences between the values in each column. 
    The position of the cell is also meaningful: for instance, the cell in the first row and the second column represents the total distance between Subject 1 and Subject 2 for instance. 

    HAC essentially tries to figure out what the most parsimonious grouping is for each possible number of groups, starting with 2 groups and finishing with the maximum number of groups (i.e. the number of rows meaning everyone is in their own group). 
    It visualizes this parsimony in the form of a dendrogram - a type of tree graph. 
    Reading dendrograms is simple, but for some people it is not very intuitive. 
    You determine the number of groups in a data set by cutting the tree. 
    You determine where to cut the tree on the horizontal where there is the *longest* vertical space without *any* branching. 
    To develop an intuition about these things, see the image below which we would cut into 2 groups - group 1 with [A, B] and group 2 with [C, D, E, F].

    .. Note::

        There are many `different clustering algorithms`_ out there, but I'll only be talking about HAC because it is basic, I'm agnostic about clustering algorithms, and I'm familiar with it. 
        You might have a strong opinion or motivation - in principle, any clustering algorithm can be applied and your needs and knowledge might dictate that others are preferable and that's perfectly valid. 

.. dropdown:: A Priori Clustering

    Canonically, there have been 2 approaches to grouping: clustering and binning. 

    Binning is simply the researcher *asserting* that it is the case that groups 1 and 2 are differentiable on X or Y: the grouping is only as valid as the researcher's reasoning.
    Further, this approach is theoretically only valid when specified a priori (in a preregistration).  

    On the other hand, Clustering is an empirical, data-driven approach which provides ad-hoc explanations. 
    Essentially, whichever Clustering Algorithm you use searches for the best solution to the problem you offer it. 
    Thus, the groups are determined by the observed data and can obviously be biased therein. 

    Here, we clearly don't have any real data: we want to cluster the simulated model predictions. 
    This is the most ideal situation: since we can simulate as much data as we want and therefore exhaustively represent the variance in expected behavior. 
    Here, we also group based on the model predictions (i.e. our hypotheses) - which means that our clustered groupings are a logical extension of our psychological theory in the context of our Experimental Paradigm and Trial Set.
    This enables us to overcome the limitations of both clustering (ad-hoc, sampling dependency, atheoretical) and binning (arbitrariness, overreliance on reasoning, etc.). 

    However, the validity of a priori clustering requires that our model be highly generalizable: all :bdg-secondary:`Constructs` must have the same value on the same :bdg-primary:`Trial` for each subject and there are no :bdg-success:`Free Parameters` in your model which do not translate to psychologically meaningful differences.. 
    So, for instance, this might preclude using binary choice tasks which often require :bdg-success:`Free Parameters` to model response bias parameters (preference for left-versus-right) and inverse heat parameters (probability of behaving preference-congruent) for example. 
    It also requires that all :bdg-secondary:`Constructs` are directly computed from :bdg-primary:`Experimental Variables` and not self-report measures for instance. 
    In this study, the experimenters asked what the participant thought the Investor expected for all trials: although this would be a theoretically superior way to mathematically calculate :bdg-secondary-line:`Guilt`, using the a priori clustering to group subjects would be conceptually problematic. 
    In these cases, it is always good to make sure that the generalized :bdg-secondary:`Constructs` is highly correlated with the questionnaire measure and that using either value leads to the same behavioral conclusions - not just taking for granted that these are distinctions without differences. 

.. dropdown:: Informing a Change in the of :bdg-primary:`Trial Set`

    Our :bdg-primary:`Trial Set` is designed to elicit maximally different behavioral patterns between groups of people who have different psychological preferences. 
    Some rules of thumb here are as follows:
    
    1. Offer as many choice options as is possible, within reason
    2. Make sure the number of trials in each condition of interest are equal 

    Here, HAC especially can offer insight about if you have accomplished these two aims. 
    Let's take a look at some minor mistakes that were made in this study. 

    .. dropdown:: Limited :bdg-danger:`Choice` Options and Asymetric :bdg-primary:`Trial Set`

        In the paper, the Choice Options were ``in increments of 1 token or 10% of the slider range (whichever was greatest, to increase the speed of movement on the slider`` and the trial distribution was not 10 trials per multiplier condition (with Investment ranging fro 1 to 10). 
        For the exact trial distribution you can see the file ``trialSet.csv`` in the folder that you downloaded with the actual data. 

        .. Note::

            The authors also conducted a behavioral follow-up to validate a different clustering which they applied in the paper. 

        Using HAC on *these* simulations leads to the following dendrogram which favors a 2 group solution and the following model space which is less in line with our expected outcome of either a 3 or 4 cluster solution as specified in our hypotheses.

        It also leads to the following grouping for a 4 cluster solution which is not well aligned with the parameter space that we sketched out earlier.

    Having the :bdg-danger:`Choice` Options always Specified in Increments of 1 Token leads to the following with the same :bdg-primary:`Trial Set`

            We need to compute a distance matrix which will require a table or data frame object which contains the model predictions. 
            Then we will use an HAC algorithm to cluster the data. 
            After, we will determine how many groups we should have and we will cut the tree into that many groups - assigning row identities to whichever group the clustering algorithm says that they belong to.

            We want to plot the :bdg-success:`Free Parameters` - each row as a point with the color being the groups assigned based on HAC. 
            Let's name our clusters based on the way we sketched out our parameter space - the three motives we identified and the behavioral strategy of Moral Opportunism we identified. 
            The top left of the parameter space is Inequity-Aversion. 
            The top right of the parameter space is Guilt-Aversion. 
            The far right of the parameter space is Greed. 
            The rest of the parameter space is the Moral Opportunism strategy.
