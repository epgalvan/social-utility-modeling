We will have 4 tutorials that you can complete: 

1. `van Baar, Chang, & Sanfey, 2019`_ - this looked at different social motives across people (data for `Tutorial 1`_ available here)
2. `Galvan & Sanfey, 2024`_ - this looked at different social motives across people and across conditions (data for `Tutorial 2`_ available here)
3. `Crockett et al., 2014`_ - this looked at how a certain social motive changed across conditions in a binary choice task (data for `Tutorial 3`_ available here, note that this data will come from `Yu et al., 2022`_ since the 2014 paper's dataset is not publicly available)
4. `Li et al., 2022`_ - this looked at competing social motives within a person in a binary choice task (data for `Tutorial 4`_ available here)

**Please note that Tutorials 3 & 4 are under development **

For all tutorials, we will work through each step as though we want to conduct the research ourselves. 
So don't read the articles just yet - let's work through this process together first! 
I would really discourage you from doing all the tutorials at once - on your first read-through, choose one tutorial to follow and always try to fully understand the lesson before moving on to the tutorial. 

If you are selecting a tutorial and don't have a preference based on the description above, I recommend doing the first tutorial to start out. 
I learned how to do computational modeling using this dataset myself and I think it's a really nice, intuitive exemplar that should be pretty easy to follow and latch your knowledge onto.
