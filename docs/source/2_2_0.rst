Compute Model Fit Index
*************

Goals During this Stage
==========

So now we should be ascertain the model predictions for each subject which we can compare to their actual behavior on each trial. 
We mentioned already that this will enable us to determine how well the model performed, but how do we actually do this?
We want to assess model accuracy: here, telling us how well our model predicts actual behavior. 
The sum of squared errors should give us a pretty good estimate of the model accuracy on a trial-by-trial basis. 
However, we also want to penalize models for having more and more parameters. 
So how do we mathematically do this?

    Well, there are a few options that you have in terms of chosing between existing Model Fit Indices. 
    The standard choices are between the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
