Premises
===========

.. dropdown:: Premise 1: People act in a way which maximizes their Subjective Utility
    
    ``Subjective Utility`` - personally experienced satisfaction

    .. dropdown:: Cumulative Prospect Theory (`Tverksy & Kahneman, 1992`_) disproved this, right?

        The short answer is yes. Prospect Theory advanced 4 notions which are problematic for our purposes:

        1. The carrier of value is gains and losses, not net value

        2. Perceptions of probabilities reflect diminishing sensitivity.

        3. Risk attitudes change as a function of probability and outcome (gains or losses)

        4. The framing of choices affects preferences


        **Then why do we stil endorse this premise? **

        1. Prospect Theory advances the notion that people do act in what they *perceive* to be in their best interest, but this perception is warped by several psychological factors - thus, the underlying idea is the same but the mathematical implementation differs.
        
        2. The decision-making tasks used often lead to model predictions are not meaningfully different between a Subjective Utility Theory and Prospect Theory - thus, we ought to adopt the more parsimonious model.

    .. Note:: 
        Although this is suited for most social decision making paradigms we will discuss, we recommend that whenever you use paradigms involving uncertainty, you consider using an alternative kind of model and strongly consider using the probability weighting function from `Tverksy & Kahneman, 1992`_.

.. dropdown:: Premise 2: Subjective Utility is derived from both economic and social goods 
    
    ``Economic Goods`` - goods which are objectively useful to people but require effort to obtain (money, food, water, shelter, etc.)
    ``Social Goods`` - goods which are subjectively experienced via real or imagined social interactions (fairness, equality, self-validation, etc.)

    .. Note::
        When referencing this, consider citing `Levy & Glimcher, 2012`_, `Bartra et al. 2013`_, and `Ruff & Fehr, 2014`_


Logical Implications
=========

    .. tab-set::
        .. tab-item:: Symbolic Logic

            :bdg-primary:`If` **the Desire to Maximize Subjective Utility** :octicon:`arrow-right;1em` **Decision**,

            :bdg-secondary:`Then` **Subjective Utility (Decision) = max(Subjective Utility (Decision Set))** 

        .. tab-item:: Plain English

            Since we have adopted the premise that people make decisions based on what will maximize their Subjective Utility, the Decision that a person has made **must** have the Highest Subjective Utility out of all of the possible Decisions that that person could have made.

    For our purposes, this means that we can ascertain how much Subjective Utility people derive from both Economic Goods and Social Goods from their behavior in Social Decision-Making Tasks, given that we create decision sets that .

    Therefore, in Experimental Paradigms where people have to choose between doing some prosocial thing against having more money, we can infer something about the Subjective Utility they derive from each outcome. 
    Social Utility models often weight an individual's preferences for economic goods against their preferences for social goods, but can also simulataneously weight preferences for different social goods against each other.
