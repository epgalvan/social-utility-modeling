Premises
===========

.. dropdown:: Premise 1: People act in a way which maximizes their Subjective Utility
    
    ``Subjective Utility`` - personally experienced satisfaction

    .. dropdown:: Cumulative Prospect Theory (`Tverksy & Kahneman, 1992`_) disproved this, right?
        The short answer is yes. Prospect Theory advanced 4 notions which are problematic for our purposes:

        1. The carrier of value is gains and losses, not net value

        2. Perceptions of probabilities reflect diminishing sensitivity.

        3. Risk attitudes change as a function of probability and outcome (gains or losses)

        4. The framing of choices affects preferences


        So, why do we still stand behind this premise? 
        Well, the decision-making tasks we use often lead to model predictions are not meaningfully different between a Subjective Utility Theory and Prospect Theory. 
        We favor Subjective Utility because it is parsimonious. 
        However, we recommend that, whenever you use risky, social choice paradigms, you consider using a different model.

.. dropdown:: Premise 2: Subjective Utility is derived from both economic and social goods 
    
    ``Economic Goods`` - goods which are objectively useful to people but require effort to obtain (money, food, water, shelter, etc.)
    ``Social Goods`` - goods which are subjectively experienced via real or imagined social interactions (fairness, equality, self-validation, etc.)

Inferences
=========
If it is true that people behave in a way that maximizes their Subjective Utility, it must be true that their behavior reflects how they value goods. 
Therefore, in Experimental Paradigms where people have to choose between doing some prosocial thing against having more money, we can infer something about the Subjective Utility they derive from each outcome. 
Social Utility models often weight an individual's preferences for economic goods against their preferences for social goods, but can also simulataneously weight preferences for different social goods against each other.
