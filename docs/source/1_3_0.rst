Goals During this Stage
================

Before we can start to develop an mathematical model of behavior, we have to establish a conceptual model of how :bdg-danger:`decisions` are made in your scenario that comports with your hypotheses. 


The central theoretical question we want our Equation to answer is this:

What :bdg-success:`meaningful psychological differences between people` determine how much :bdg-warning:`Utility` they derive from their :bdg-danger:`decisions` in any situation of interest, 
where the situation as defined by the :bdg-primary:`independent variables` and :bdg-primary:`constants`.

1. For each hypothesis, think of the central appetitive or aversive motive that would lead people to make such :bdg-danger:`decisions`
2. Think about *how* the :bdg-danger:`decisions` people make enable them to act on their environment ( :bdg-primary:`independent variables` and :bdg-primary:`constants` ) to avoid or obtain whatever is motivating them according to each hypothesis
3. Now think about *how* other :bdg-danger:`decisions` that people could make would prevent them from avoiding or obtaining whatever is motivating them according to each hypothesis.
4. Taking a step back now, identify the dimensions which are implied by the :bdg-success:`meaningful psychological differences between people` you have identified in your hypotheses - what way are these people quantitatively different?

By now, you should have a conceptual model of how :bdg-primary:`independent variables`, :bdg-primary:`constants` , and :bdg-danger:`decisions` relate to the :bdg-success:`meaningful psychological differences between people` identified by each hypothesis, 
so you can proceed to actually designing the equation. 

Tutorial
================

.. dropdown:: For each hypothesis, think of the central appetitive or aversive motive that would lead people to make such :bdg-danger:`decisions`.

    1. Greed - a desire to obtain money (or an aversion to losing money)
    2. Inequity Aversion - an aversion to creating inequity (or a desire to achieve equity)    
    3. Guilt Aversion - an aversion to violating others' expectations (or a desire to meet others' expectation)

.. dropdown:: Think about *how* the :bdg-danger:`decisions` people make enable them to act on their environment ( :bdg-primary:`independent variables` and :bdg-primary:`constants` ) to avoid or obtain whatever is motivating them according to each hypothesis.

    1. Greed - people keep and take as much money as they can
    2. Inequity Aversion - people give back enough money so that them and their partner have an equal amount     
    3. Guilt Aversion - people give back enough money so that their partners' expectations are met

.. dropdown:: Now think about *how* other :bdg-danger:`decisions` that people could make would prevent them from avoiding or obtaining whatever is motivating them according to each hypothesis.

    1. Greed - not keeping (or taking) as much money as one possibly can does not maximize one's payoff
    2. Inequity Aversion - not giving enough money back so that them and their partner have an equal amount results in inequity
    3. Guilt Aversion - not giving their partner what they expect results in the violation of another person's expectations which results in feeling guilty

.. dropdown:: Taking a step back now, identify the dimensions which are implied by the :bdg-success:`meaningful psychological differences between people` you have identified in your hypotheses - what way are these people quantitatively different?

    1. Greedy people act in their own material self-interest while both Inequity Averse and Guilt Averse people act in others' self-interest
    2. Inequity Averse people act in others' material self-interest based on a desire to maintain equality - to be objectively fair
    3. Guilt Averse people are motivated to act in others' material self-interest based on a desire to meet expectations - to be perceived as being fair

    Dimensions:

    * :bdg-success:`D1` - ranges from prosociality (low) to greed (high)
    * :bdg-success:`D2` - ranges from acting based on perceived fairness (low) to objective fairness (high)

    In our lab, to keep things simple we always refer to :bdg-success:`D1` as Θ (Theta) and we associate low values with prosocial preferences and associate high values with selfish preferences. 

    We also always refer to :bdg-success:`D2` as Φ (Phi) and we select which social norm it will refer to on an arbitrary basis.

Do we have a conceptual model of how :bdg-primary:`independent variables`, :bdg-primary:`constants` , and :bdg-danger:`decisions` relate to the :bdg-success:`meaningful psychological differences between people` identified by each hypothesis? 

Yes we do, so let's proceed to actually designing the equation!
