In this section, we will look at the standard paradigms which are used in social utility modeling. 
We will be referring to the standard 1-shot paradigms: multiple interactions nearly always ought to be modelled using learning models. 

These tasks are often amended to answer specific research questions. 
Thus, if we know the standard

            Both Players make a simaltaneous decision about whether to cooperate or defect. 
            If both players cooperate, they usually receive a nice payout. 
            If one player cooperates and the other defects, the defector receives a much larger payout than the cooperator. 
            However, if both players defect, they both get nothing.
