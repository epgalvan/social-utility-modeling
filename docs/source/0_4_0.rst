In this section, we will look at the standard paradigms which are used in social utility modeling. 
We will be referring to the standard 1-shot paradigms: multiple interactions nearly always ought to be modelled using learning models. 

These tasks are often amended to answer specific research questions. 
Thus, if we know the standard game design we can think about how to change it to answer our research questions.


Prisoner's Dilemma
===========

        Both Players make a simaltaneous decision about whether to cooperate or defect. 
        If both players cooperate, they usually receive a nice payout. 
        If one player cooperates and the other defects, the defector receives a much larger payout than the cooperator. 
        However, if both players defect, they both get nothing.

                * Cooperation Decision

    .. tab-item:: Typical Behaivor

        * 37% of the time people cooperate (`Mengel, 2017`_)
        * What causes defection is debated - risk and temptation are difficult to disentangle in this situation
        * Almost unusable for our purposes due to the fact that it is a risky choice and not many variables can be manipulated - often used in an iterated design to study strategic decision-making

    .. tab-item:: Notable Variants

        1. Asymetric Costs/Benefits
        2. Sequential Decision-Making

Public Goods Game
=============

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Task Design

        .. figure:: pgg_gif.gif
            :figwidth: 100%
            :align: center

        All Players receive an Endowment (money given by the experimenter to use in the game) and make a simaltaneous decision about how much to contribute to a community pot. 
        The community pot is multiplied and equally distributed among all players, regardless of contribution. 
        Payouts are the sum of money not contributed to the community pot and money received from the community pot.

        .. grid:: 2

                * Contribution Amount (Individual)
                * Total Wealth (Group)

    .. tab-item:: Typical Behavior

        * Most people give at least something, average giving behavior is 37.7% of the Endowment (`Zelmer, 2003`_)
        * Considered to measure cooperation
        * To use in social utility modeling, it may require this game be played sequentially to make this a non-risky choice - more often used in repeated interactions to study group-level dynamics (i.e. Total Wealth accumulated over a certain number of trials)

    .. tab-item:: Notable Variants

        1. Asymetric Costs/Benefits
        2. Asymetric Endowments
        3. Earned Endowments
        4. Minimum Combined Contributions
        5. Sequential Decision-Making

Ultimatum Game 
================

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Task Design

        .. figure:: ug_gif.gif
            :figwidth: 100%
            :align: center

        The Proposer receives an Endowment and makes an Ultimatum Offer to the Responder. 
        The Responder decides to accept the Ultimatum Offer - in which case both players receive the division according to the Ultimatum - or reject it - in which case both players receive nothing.

        .. grid:: 2

            .. grid-item-card:: Proposer
                :columns: 12

                * Most proposers offer around 40% of the Endowment (`Camerer, 2011`_`)
                * Ultimatums reflect first order-beliefs and thus, Proposing Behavior consider to measure Strategic Bargaining

            .. grid-item-card:: Responder
                :columns: 12
                
                * 99% of people accept Ultimatums of 50% of the Endowment, 90% of people accept Ultimatums of 40% of the Endowment
                * 65% of people accept Ultimatums of 30% of the Endowment
                * 50% of people accept Ultimatums of 20% of the Endowment
                * 70% of people accept Ultimatums 10% of Endomment
                * Responses measure tolerance of unfairness

        The Investor is given an Endowment. 
        They must then decide how much to invest and how much to keep for themselves. 
        Any money kept is guaranteed payout. 
        Any money invested is multiplied and given to the Trustee who must then decide how much to keep and how much to return.

                * Returned Amount is considered to be a measure of Positive Reciprocity

            :align: center

        Both Players are given an Endowment and the Taker is allowed to take a certain amount of the Victim's Endowment - usually a maximum of 50% of the Endowment. 
        Then, the Victim is allowed to spend a certain amount of money to destroy the Taker's money. 
        The money destroyed is usually 3 times what the Victim spent.
