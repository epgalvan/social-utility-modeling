In this section, we will look at the standard paradigms which are used in social utility modeling. 
We will be referring to the standard 1-shot paradigms: multiple interactions nearly always ought to be modelled using learning models. 

These tasks are often amended to answer specific research questions. 
Thus, if we know the standard game design we can think about how to change it to answer our research questions.

            Both Players make a simaltaneous decision about whether to cooperate or defect. 
            If both players cooperate, they usually receive a nice payout. 
            If one player cooperates and the other defects, the defector receives a much larger payout than the cooperator. 
            However, if both players defect, they both get nothing.

        .. tab-item:: Stylized Facts

            * Although defecting is always better for each Player, around 37% of the time people cooperate (`Mengel, 2017`_)
            * What causes defection is debated - risk and temptation are difficult to disentangle in this situation
            * Almost unusable for our purposes due to the fact that it is a risky choice and not many variables can be manipulated - often used in an iterated design to study strategic decision-making

            All Players receive an Endowment (money given by the experimenter to use in the game) and make a simaltaneous decision about how much to contribute to a community pot. 
            The community pot is multiplied and equally distributed among all players, regardless of contribution. 
            Payouts are the sum of money not contributed to the community pot and money received from the community pot.

                    * Total Wealth (Group)

        .. tab-item:: Stylized Facts

            * Most people give at least something, average giving behavior is 37.7% of the Endowment (`Zelmer, 2003`_)
            * Considered to measure cooperation
            * To use in social utility modeling, it require this game be played sequentially to make this a non-risky choice - more often used in repeated interactions to study group-level dynamics (i.e. Total Wealth accumulated over a certain number of trials)

            The Proposer receives an Endowment and makes an Ultimatum Offer to the Responder. 
            The Responder decides to accept the Ultimatum Offer - in which case both players receive the division according to the Ultimatum - or reject it - in which case both players receive nothing.
