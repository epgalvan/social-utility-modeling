This handbook contains information about what social utility models are, why one would use them, and how to implement them in R. 
It contains both theory and tutorial, though it much more focused on the tuturial. 

Required Foreknowledge
=============

There is no required foreknowledge, but some skills will help.

Coding
--------
There are no specific functions called in the tutorial: we are writing our own code wherever possible. 
Therefore, if you also know a statistical programming language (i.e. R, Python, or MatLab) you will be able to immediately implement this approach in your own research.
Additionally, if you do not know a programming language, you will still understand what we are trying to accomplish and why. 

Statistics
----------
If you have some basic knowledge of linear modeling (i.e. t-tests, ANOVA, regression) you will certainly be able to follow this lesson. 
However, we are not taking for granted that you know commonsense statistical principles, so this should not prohibit anyone.
