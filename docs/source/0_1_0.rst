This handbook contains information about what social utility models are, why one would use them, and how to implement them in R (Matlab and Python are currently under development). 
It contains both theory and practical implementation, though it much more focused on the practical implementation. 

Required Foreknowledge
=============

There is no required foreknowledge, but knowing programming and statistics will help.

.. dropdown:: Programming

    If you also know a statistical programming language, even at a basic level, you will be able to immediately implement this approach in your own research. 
    The documentation is written in R, MatLab, and Python but the documentation is also written and justified in plain English to enable readers to follow the logic of each step.

    However, if you do not know a programming language, you will still be able to understand what we are trying to accomplish and why. 
    This is because we are writing out all of our analyses and providing plain English documentation rather than using preexisting functions - it enables the reader to comprehend how and why . 
    However, you will obviously not be able to then implement this yourself until you learn the basics of a programing language.

.. dropdown:: Statistics
    
    If you have some basic knowledge of linear modeling (i.e. t-tests, ANOVA, regression) you will find certain topics that you already understand. 
    
    However, we are not taking for granted that you know commonsense statistical principles, so this should not prohibit anyone.
