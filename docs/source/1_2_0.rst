Goals During this Stage
================

After establishing the research question you want to answer, you must create an experimental paradigm that enables you to answer that question.
As an aspirational benchmark, every potential answer to that research question should have a distinguishable behavioral trend over the course of the experiment which enables you to differentiate between other psychological accounts.

Here, your experimental design and hypotheses are codetermined: in reflecting on the possible answers to your research question, you should identify what behavioral patterns these psychological mechanisms would produce in the current design.

If psychological differences make behaviorally distinct predictions in the current experiment, your design is adequate. 
Importantly, at this stage it is necessary to exhaustively list both all possible psychological accounts for your question as well as the behavioral patterns in your experiment. 
The purpose of doing the latter is to identify possible behavioral differences that might not correspond to any of your psychological hypotheses, but might relate to another psychological preference.

===========

So, the main goal at this stage is to identify an experimental design which allows to answer our research question, namely **What motivates people to reciprocate trust in single-shot interactions?**

Let's follow the steps mentioned above.


.. card:: Identify Plausible Answers

    Well, we already know that some people do not reciprocate trust in single-shot interactions so let's jot down ``Greed`` as our first proposed answer. 

    1. Greed

    However, most people do reciprocate trust so what explanations may we propose for this? 
    Well, traditional thought on the matter has been in favor of the explanation provided by inequity-aversion (see `Fehr & Schmidt, 1999`_ for the initial formulation of this inequity-aversion utility model).
    In other words, people value being objectively fair which leads them to reciprocate trust in the context of the 1-shot Trust Game - let's add ``Inequity Aversion`` to our list. 

    2. Inequity Aversion

    However, we also know that when people do not behave in a way that is inequity-averse when they have the opportunity to appear fair while actually being selfish in the Ultimatum Game (`GÃ¼th, Huck, & Ockenfels, 1996`_).
    Thus, rather than actually being fair, it could be the case that people reciprocate trust because they want to avoid feeling guilty for betraying the Investor's trust. 
    So, let's also add ``Guilt Aversion`` to our list as well. 

    3. Guilt Aversion. 

    Nice, we have 3 explanations - can you think of any more? Well I can't and neither could the authors so let's proceed with these answers. 

.. card:: Experimental Design

    We are interested in reciprocity of trust - this tells us we should most likely use the Trust Game. 
    So, working under this logic, we should now identify if any of our plausible answers predict the same behavior in the Trust Game. 

    Well, Greed is certainly distinct from the other 2 - greedy people don't reciprocate and the others do. 
    However, Inequity Aversion and Guilt Aversion lead to quite similar predictions: Inequity Aversion leads to people giving around half, as does Guilt Aversion since Trustees generally believe that Investors expect to receive half of the multiplied investment back. 

    So the question now is: *How do we make Inequity Aversion and Guilt Aversion have different patterns of behavior in the Trust Game?* 
    Well clearly we have to create situations where returning half of the multiplied investment (i.e. inequity-aversion) does not result in Investors believing that they received half of the multiplied investment back.
